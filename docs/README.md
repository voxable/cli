**Access your team’s source of conversational AI truth with the Voxable API & CLI.**

Using the [Voxable](https://voxable.io) API & CLI is the easiest way to automate exportation of your team‘s conversation design data. You can export your existing projects and transform them for importation into a [growing list of conversational AI tools](/plugins).

## Generating an API token

In order to access the Voxable API, you'll need to begin by [emailing the team to request access](mailto:support@voxable.io). We‘ll enable the API feature for your Voxable account.

Once the API feature is enabled, you’ll need to generate an API token. From the profile menu, select [Profile > API Tokens](https://voxable.design/api_keys):

Click the “Create an API Token” button to generate a new Voxable API token:

With your token generated, you now have two options for how to go about accessing the Voxable API:

* [Directly via API calls](/api)
* [With the Voxable command-line interface](/cli)
