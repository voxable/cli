# The Voxable API

The Voxable API enables access to all of the conversation design data your team has created in Voxable.

## Documentation

Check out [the Voxable API documentation](https://api.voxable.io/) for example code and a list of all available API calls.

## Authentication

You'll need to have a `.voxablerc.yml` configuration file in place with your API token. This can be in the same directory in which voxable is run, or any directory above it.

You can also copy code to execute on the terminal that will set up this file in your home directory from your API token settings page:
