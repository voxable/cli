# Voxable CLI Plugin: Bespoken

![The Bespoken llama logo.](/images/bespoken/bespoken-logo.png)

[Bespoken](https://bespoken.io/) provides automated testing and monitoring tools for voice & IVR experiences. With the Voxable CLI Bespoken plugin, you can transform your Voxable designs directly into [Bespoken automated end-to-end tests](https://read.bespoken.io/end-to-end/getting-started/):

Here, we see a transformation of a simple Voxable project:

```sh-session
$ voxable bespoken:transform [PROJECT_ID]
ðŸ“¦ Exporting project...... done
---
configuration:
  locales: en-US
  voiceId: Joey

---
- test: Launch request only
- "Alexa, open Simple Project.": hello I am simple project you can say a task or cancel to quit how can I help you today

---
- test: Launch request, add task
- "Alexa, open Simple Project.": hello I am simple project you can say a task or cancel to quit how can I help you today
- "Add a task.": sorry I'm not going to do that actually goodbye

---
- test: Launch request, add task
- "Alexa, open Simple Project.": hello I am simple project you can say a task or cancel to quit how can I help you today
- "Cancel.": goodbye
```
Adding the above to a Bespoken end-to-end test would result in the following test run, if run against [the Simple Project example from the API documentation](../api/):
